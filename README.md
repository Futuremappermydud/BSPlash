# BSPlash
Displays a ingame overlay displaying your scoresaber stats.

Note! This uses the unfinished scoresaber api found here
https://new.scoresaber.com/api/player/2429129807113296/basic (replace the id with your own)

This also requires you too have a little space directly on c: drive and you need too create the "UserData"
Folder youself.
